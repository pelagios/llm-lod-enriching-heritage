<h4>What's a recipe?</h3>

You can think of 'recipes' as a set of instructions for creating a specific thing with a set of ingredients. Recipes can be bundled together into 'cookbooks'.

We are imagining users who are interested in experimenting with recipes that demonstrate what is possible and potentially valuable for Culturual Heritage contexts when combinging LOD and LLMs. Less technically-oriented users may consider browsing the recipes to provide adaptable inspiration to share with funding bodies, technical and collections colleagues. Developers may be interested in mining the cookbook for ideas and adaptable code elements.

In this case, we've created recipes for people who work with cultural heritage collections to show something of what's possible with AI and linked open data.
