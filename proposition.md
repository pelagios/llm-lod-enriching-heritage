The following cookbook provides different recipes, derived from LOD and LLM technologies, for enabling CH institutions to enrich their metadata at scale. We envisage two user profiles of the cookbook. One user will be a collections manager who is interested in making use of digital technologies for enriching their objects, but won't necessarily have the technical expertise to do this for themselves. The second user, who has more technical proficiency, will be able to use our recipes as an inspiration or basis for their own work.

The cookbook has the following structure. It has notebooks for:
1. Data preparation and processes â€” in which we set out: (i) how to get the data in a format that can be used in these processes; and (ii) the different ways of identifying named entities and then disambiguating them.
2. Evaluation - in which we set out how to assess the results of the data processing according to standard metrics.
3. Applications - in which we set out examples use cases for what you'll be able to do with the processed data.

There is also a Glossary of Concepts, as well as Additional Information about the 2025 workshop, awesome resources, and use-case scenarios.
