# About the Workshop

The 'Enriching Digital Heritage with LLMs and Linked Open Data' workshop took place 8 - 12 September 2025 at the Lorentz Center@lambda in Leiden, the Netherlands. Over five days, experts in Digital Cultural Heritage from across Europe and the US explored the transformative potential of combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and Linked Open Data (LOD) to enrich cultural heritage metadata in ways that foster FAIR usage. The workshop made the problem space of working with Named Entities more tractable by dividing it into three core processes: Recognition, Disambiguation, and Relations. The workshop also provided a forum for knowledge exchange amongst participants with experience in Cultural Heritage standards, LOD, LLMs and Named Entity Recognition, and explicitly engaged with the challenges presented by validation, bias, and the ethical processing of heritage data. 

The workshop was made possible with funding from the Lorentz Center.
