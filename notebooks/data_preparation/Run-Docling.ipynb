Also the rectangular ornaments are mainly grouped around a central axis The compositions are either centralized or formed of chains of continuous and intermittent wave tendrils; which frequently, at the point, form centralized motifs such as, for example; a lyre, or heart-shaped design; thus once more interrupting the continuous fow of the tendril. facing gold meeting again\n",

Another eastern Europe, was disintegrating the Celtic art concept to such a degree as to cause it to be unrecognizable.  Rostovtzeff describes* the infuence of Iranian (Sarmatian?) art on the classical art of Hellenistic Greece and Rome exercised the medium of the Greek centers on the shores of from the second century B.G. on, through the Black Sea in South Russia. According to him this influence showed itself in the sudden neglect of refinement of ornament and form in toreutic art and jewelry, in the emphasis on color as well as light and shade efects to the detriment of plasticity, in static; geometricized designs in place of the classical flowing and organic designs ' Strzygowskie also mentions the possibility of an iniuence of the stylized and abstract animal representations in Siberian and Ananjino (East Russian) art on the process of geometrization of the classical tendril. To this is to be added a predilection for openwork which already in early Celtic art had been evolved under a certain amount of influence from the Caucasus. But in early Celtic art the openwork technique was still rare. the first and second centuries of our era the openwork technique was increasingly in use in Eastern art, and by that period Eastern art had begun to be a prominent factor in the making of the art of the West through its contact on the shores of the Black Sea with the Romans and with Germanic tribes Therefore; the East may have contributed considerably to the development of openwork technique, coincident with the taste for 'coloristic' rather than plastic effects in metal art. art technique, During art in Italy itself.

Yet whether the trumpet design developed directly from the classical motif; as I believe; or indirectly through the British derivative is not as important as it is to see that the classical motif must have been its original source and that the transformation into an abstract design was accomplished by Celtic art. In the finest examples of trumpet compositions the trumpet always precedes the springing of an offshoot (see the frames of Nos. 1, 2, and 17).

Jacobsthal suggests, 16 with regard to identical designs in Celtic art, that in some patterns the lozenge seems to have been there first and the adornment of the borders; with outward cup spirals, to have been an addition; while in other patterns there was first the arrangement of four cup spirals against each other: According to him the motif may from the beginning have had roots, which lead from Mycenae to archaic Greece and Italy and thence to Hallstatt and La Tène. The designs among Jacobsthals examples which are closest to the Roman provincial interpretation of the motif are Patterns 202, taken from a Pontic oenochoe of Etruscan afiliation, and 203, an ornament from the sword from Melgunow (South Russia). At the where the cup spirals meet with two outward curving ends there is frequently a small filling-in motif between these ends, in which case the design assumes the shape of a palmette with outward curling side leaves: the Dura bronzes great variety is achieved in the application of this motif through interchanging use of itive and interval design.

As a rule there was a floral element in the center. Lehmann assumes that the distribution of frequency of use of the 'pelta' as ornamental device makes it probable that Celtic tribes had adopted it as a symbol and that it probably was a moon symbol. He expressed the opinion that there is reason to believe that the Amazon 'pelta' originated in the Near East but that actually its origins are unknown and that it may at all times rather have been a symbol than in actual use as a piece of armor: But it is more likely that the shape of the Amazon is derived from that of the Amazon ax ~in fact, that the was derived from the ax.

Following this simplification; and in accordance with new tendencies in taste as a result of trends from the East, which partly ignored and partly negated the classical floral ornament, it came about that the palmette became interchangeable with the This is confirmed by the evidence of the Dura ornaments, among which only the flattest and crudest designs; such as Nos. 5 and 6, have strictly 'peltae' devices\\_although even here the stems retained foral character\\_whereas plastic and beautifully executed ornaments, such as the plastic disk (No. 9) and the tendril fan fibula (No. 184, Pl XVI), retained a clearer concept of the palmette with their spur and fan devices respectively 'pelta' 'pelta. theory\n",

It must not be overlooked that in the ornamental style, the 'pelta' design is strongly interwoven with floral designs. Without doubt the semilunar device with voluted ends must have had a second root which has to be sought among floral designs. The design is like the double of the palmette: Both the palmette and the semilunar design occur incessantly together, play into each other; and are used interchangeably. Among almost pure tendril compositions; tendril ends grow out of the central stem in designs now semilunar, now palmette, now fan-shaped.  They are applied either upward or downward. The device occurs on an ornament from Novaesium?: as filling-in motif of an intermittent wave tendril, where in classical art the palmette itself used to be. In Dura, for example, we have two strap ornaments, cruciform buttons (Nos. 25, 28), one of which has palmette endings; the other; altogether more geometricized, has semilunar endings. In the design of the silver phalara (Pl.

A large animal is attacking a small animal and has its mouth down on the back of the small animal. Both animals are in and so schematized that neither the nor the dramatic nature of the scene can be discerned. Both subject matter and manner of representation are derived from nomadic art. The style is indicative of a late phase of nomadic art. We are familiar, particularly in the art of the Ordos district, from the end of the last millennium B.G on, with a similar distintegration of the plastic nomadic animal style into a two-dimensional style and with the misinterpretation of scenes in spite of the fact that there, in the Ordos district, this art was at home. Dr. N. Toll, who discussed this plaque in Rep. VII-VIII, PP. 388-890, said that the plaque, while derived from the nomadic animal style, had also something in common with Roman Celtic plates of a linear ornamental type, particularly in the completion with a fat part with two schematized confronted animals' heads at the outer end, separated from each other by an incised projection: Two bored holes are provided for the rivets; one at the inner ridge on the plain part and one on the curvature at the outer end of the pierced part. The combination into one plaque of the animal scene and the plain endpiece with the double ridge at its inner end may be indicative of the derivation of the belt ornament from a where the plain end had the functional purpose to carry hinges or hooks\\_ Actually the indented animal heads at the outer end of the plain part may have developed out of the habit of having hooks at those ends. lay against pierced species profile clasp,\n",

            "From the of view of technique, the Dura enamel belongs to the 'champlevé\" group:' As for material, they are made solely of bronze. It is highly improbable that the cavities were chiseled or rooted. However, in certain cases such as concentric circles on covers of lockets and on buttons, the circles could have been made easily by cutting them on some kind of lathe: The small triangular cavities on fibulae Nos. 26 and 27 certainly were cut. But in most cases, and especially on lockets with heart pattern, the partitions were already cut in the mold before After the the edges of the cavities probably were retouched and sharpened. point\n",

It occurs mostly in lanceolate lockets and on some fibulae. Colors most frequent are brownish red,? light blue; half translucent bright yellow, and white. The second method is a colored mosaic enamel: or millefiori, the technique of which certainly was influenced by the Egyptian mosaic glass industry. In this case, the cavities were filled with more or less regularly arranged cubes of different colors or with small splinters which were fused together: This technique makes possible greater variation of colors, more minute results, and a certain freedom from the partitions. Largely used in concentric; circular decorations, it transformed them thereby from targetlike objects into multicolored rosettes.\n",

The predominant are lanceolate, oval, circular, square, and diamond. The enamel decoration is restricted entirely to the cover, and some lanceolate lockets occur without any enamel decoration at all. The box itself is shallow; ca. mm deep. The lanceolate lockets ordinarily have three perforations on the bottom and two triangular notches on the sides. Their cover has a small knob with a short pin serving as the catch in a lock that has as its second part a receptacle on the box itself; corresponding to the pin on the cover. At the upper round part, the cover is hinged to the box The surface of the cover is divided into several compartments forming simple pattern. Each compartment is filled with two or three single-colored enamels with mosaic glass\\_ The circular lockets consist of a fat box and a fat, circular cover, the latter attached to the box at one by a and at a diametrically opposite a catch which consists of a small protruding circle with a pin on the cover, corresponding to a receptacle with a hole on the box itself to receive the pin.

It was intended, therefore, to be one-half of a bipartite mold. But the pressing was not done skillfully, or deeply enough, and the surface is s0 unevenly flattened that this half of the mold could not connect to form joint with the other part; and therefore could hardly have been used at all.

The variety in techniques and colors of the late enamels is indicative of probable simultaneous activity on the part of several workshops.

There was certainly some more or less regular supply through channels. Such supply did not, however, necessarily follow the regular commercial trade routes. One might, in fact, infer some specific and restricted system and routes of trade; supplying military posts and garrisons with such objects as were used almost exclusively by the army.

The second is a heterogeneous group of Roman provincial types which infiltrated into this military outpost with the Roman army; its appearance; therefore; must be contemporary with the Roman occupation of 165-256 A.D. The occupation of Dura by Trajan was too short to be of any significance in the dating: It is possible that some specimens had several decades of use that between the early Syrian group and the Roman provincial types no fibulae have been found, showing that in the late Hellenistic and Parthian periods fibulae were not in use by the local population at Dura. first quite\n",

Some such specimens possibly reached Syria with the Roman legions in the century and later were transferred by the soldiers of Trajan or Lucius Verus to Dura; although they could also be local imitations of the second century.

Their importation into Dura suggests either the establishment of a regular supply service from Europe, primarily from Gaul; which would account for the appearance of pierced and enameled bronzes, or the arrival of a new contingent of the Roman sometime in the first half of the third century, which brought with it contemporary decorations and ornaments . along city army\n",

The pin is hinged through the tubular crossbar or between two eyes attached to the crossbar There are many varieties of the round, rectangular; octagonal, flattened, and semicircular crosssectional bows; pointed or straight cut receptacles.
