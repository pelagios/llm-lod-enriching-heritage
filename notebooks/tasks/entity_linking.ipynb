    "# Entity linking\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook links the entities found in the previous steps (NER, Disambiguation) to the artefacts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "Making explicit the relations between the named entities helps us to better understand the data. In the context of museum artefact descriptions there are two major types of relations: relation between named entities among each other and relations between named entities and the artefacts. In the main data files used for testing the software, from the Egyptian Museum of Turin, the first group of relations is quite rare. Therefore we focus on finding relations/links between artefacts and the named entities in their description texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use large language models (LLMs) to derive the relations. To make the task manageable, we have restricted the relations to eleven types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the entity is a person depicted on or by the artefact\n",
    "2. the entity is a person that created the artefact\n",
    "3. the entity is a person that discovered the artefact\n",
    "4. the entity is a person that owned the artefact\n",
    "5. the entity is a person in power during the period of the creation of the artefact\n",
    "6. the entity is a location depicted on or by the artefact\n",
    "7. the entity is a location where the artefact was created\n",
    "8. the entity is a location where the artefact was produced\n",
    "9. the entity is a location where the artefact was discovered\n",
    "10. the entity is the artefact's current location\n",
    "11. other entity type or other relation between entity and artefact\n",
    "\n",
    "We include the definitions of these types in the prompt sent to the LLMs and ask them to select the best matching one. We offer each entity to the LLMs separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The process consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import required software libraries: We start with importing required software libraries\n",
    "2. Read the text that requires processing: Next we obtain the input text from the Disambiguation notebook\n",
    "3. Linking: The text is sent to GPT with a prompt that instructs it to select the best type for the link between the artefact and the entity\n",
    "4. Linking visualization: The link type is displayed in text with colour-coded entities\n",
    "5. Save results: Save the results of the linking process for future processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook depends on three files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* utils.py: helper functions\n",
    "* output_disambiguation_ba25101ddbe8830789bfdfdb3a5ba6312d6853e6.json: output file of disambiguation task\n",
    "* linking_cache.json: context-dependent cache of linking analysis performed earlier\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure they are available in this folder so that the notebook can run smoothly. You can download them from Github."
