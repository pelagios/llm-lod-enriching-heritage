A final note: this work is very much of the moment: September 2025. Given the rapid pace of technological change, particularly in LLMs, we anticipate that the specific tools and methods that we outline here will not be so cutting edge in a year. In other words, the recipes should not be considered a maintained service or best practice that is future-proofed, nor, indeed, a ready to go implementation. 
  
That said, we believe that these simple-to-follow recipes can be easily adapted to different scenarios, updated by new technologies, and extended for greater coverage.
